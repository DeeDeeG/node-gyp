Hello @DeeDeeG,

    Thanks massively for all you work on Node.  It really helps us to move things forward!
    
    It would be great to collaborate with you to get v8 in truly compatible with Python 3.
    
    I find the Chromium contribution process and tooling to be inscrutable and long winded but perhaps you will succeed where I have not.
    
    If you ___create a `v8-to-Python3` repo and @mention me on one of its issues___ then I can show you how I use various tools to find and fix Python 3 incompatibilities.
    
    * https://pypi.org/project/flake8
    * https://pypi.org/project/future
    * https://pypi.org/project/modernize
    * https://pypi.org/project/mypy
    * https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade
    
    These are the techniques that I used to do:
